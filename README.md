### Hi,

As a Full Stack Developer, I have been creating and enhancing web projects since 2017. I have a passion for web development. 

I recently worked at ThirdBrain SA, where I integrated Google Ads API and Facebook Ads API using PHP and Laravel. Before that, I was a Full Stack Developer at Adviad, where I added new features and targeting methods, integrated third party advertisement platform APIs, and fixed bugs and refactored old projects. I have extensive experience and expertise in Laravel, PHP, Vue.js, JavaScript and other technologies. 

I enjoy working with different web frameworks and tools, and learning new skills and best practices. I value quality, collaboration, and innovation in my work. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a web developer.
